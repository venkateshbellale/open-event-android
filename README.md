The Open Event Android project consists of two components. The **App Generator** is a web application that is hosted on a server and generates an event Android app from a zip with JSON and binary files ([examples here](http://github.com/fossasia/open-event)) or through an API. The second component we are developing in the project is a generic **Android app** - the output of the app generator. The mobile app can be installed on any Android device for browsing information about the event. Updates can be made automatically through API endpoint connections from an online source (e.g. server), which needs to defined in the provided event zip with the JSON files. The Android app has a standard configuration file, that sets the details of the app (e.g. color scheme, logo of event, link to JSON app data).

## 1. Android App

This is a generic app that has two parts:

A) A standard configuration file, that sets the details of the app (e.g. color scheme, logo of event, link to JSON app data). A sample of the JSON format is maintained in the [Open Event Repository](http://github.com/fossasia/open-event).

B) A JSON API provided by open-event-orga-servers server (Code maintained [here](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-server)).

### Sample App

A sample app for testing purposes is automatically built after commits in the repository. Please [download and test the app here](/sample-apk).

### Android App Development Set up

Please find info about the set up of the Android app in your development environment [here](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/blob/development/docs/ANDROID_APP_Setup.md).

### Data retrieval

- The orga-server provides the data which is stored in its backend database in a json format.
- The app on startup picks up data from a JSON file in its assets folder if the version number of data is -1, which happens when there is no internet connection
- If there is a valid internet connection, the data download starts from the server.
- Also there is a check on the version of data already there in the app's database. If data is stale then only it is downloaded.
- If database is empty then firstly JSON file in assets is accessed but if internet is available , latest data is downloaded.

## 2. App Generator

The App Generator is a simple one-page HTML webpage that allows the user to input details and upload or link to the required event data to automatically build the Android application. The user needs to provide the following:

1. App's Name
2. E-Mail address where the generated app will be sent to
3. a) Either a zip with all event data including JSON data and binary image and audio files or b) an API Link providing the same information as the zip file

The Generator needs to be hosted on a server backed up by a PHP script which in turn executes Python and Bash scripts which start the app's build process. After the app is generated, it is emailed to the user using [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) and [MSMTP](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/).

For the API part, the app does not use Firebase for sending data to the server, instead the app directly sends data to `api.php` in the API call. Digging deeper in the code of `api.php`, first the app checks for a valid request (GET/POST) and throws an error if it is invalid. Next, for a valid request the app stores the body into a variable and then executes a follow-up script.

### Sample app

A sample installation of the app generator web-page is [here](http://45.55.58.149/). For the access to the API please use http://45.55.58.149/api/api.php. You can use a sample of the JSON format from the [Open Event Repository](http://github.com/fossasia/open-event).

#### How do I deploy Web App Generator with Heroku

Please read how to deploy to [Heroku here](/docs/INSTALLATION_HEROKU.md)

### Accessing the App Generator

An app generator can be accessed in two ways, via an App Generator Web-Page, that runs on an the APACHE server or via POST API. The POST API takes input in form of a JSON and then creates and emails you the app. To access it via a POST API in your app installation you need to go to http://your-URL/api/api.php. The POST API takes input in form of a JSON and then creates and emails you the app.

### Sending a POST Request

You can use [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) for Chrome or [RESTClient](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/restclient/) for Firefox for making API calls easily.

Input to the API should be of the following format <br>
```{ "email": "example@example.com", "app_name": "Name", "endpoint": "http://valid-endpoint.com/" } ```<br>

After taking the request through the POST API, the app will be generated and emailed to the email address provided in the request body.
